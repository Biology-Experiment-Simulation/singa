/**
 * Diffusivity or diffusion coefficient is a proportionality constant between
 * the molar flux due to molecular diffusion and the gradient in the
 * concentration of the species (or the driving force for diffusion). The higher
 * the diffusivity (of one substance with respect to another), the faster they
 * diffuse into each other.
