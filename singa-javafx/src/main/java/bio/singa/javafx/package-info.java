/**
 * The Javafx module provides means to visualize data from the framework directly. The Renderer allows to render objects
 * from the mathematics/geometry package to any GraphicsContext provided by Javafx. A viewer for graphs is implemented
 * to visualize and arrange graphs. A very simple viewer for macromolecular structures is also available. Different
 * examples and Playgrounds are provided.
 *
 * This module requires the Orace version of the JDK.
