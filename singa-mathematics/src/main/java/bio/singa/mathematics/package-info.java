 * The mathematics package contains the basic mathematical structures for frequent bioinformatic applications. This
 * encompasses different classes of graphs, trees, matrices, vectors, geometry, metrics and a little topology.
 *
 * Further algorithms such as matrix decompositions, graph path finding and vector super imposition and voronoi diagram
 * creation are provided.
